## Installation & Usage

> For both methods follow the prompts to configure your project. Once completed, a new directory containing your project will be created. Then navigate into your newly created project directory and follow the instructions in the `README.md` to complete the setup of your project.

### Method 1: Using the CLI tool (Recommended)

Install the `uvi` tool globally:

```bash
uv tool install uvi
```

```bash
# or using pip
pip install uvi
```

Then navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and run:

```bash
uvi
```

### Method 2: Using Cookiecutter directly

Alternatively, you can use cookiecutter directly:

```bash
uvx cookiecutter https://github.com/shaneholloman/uvi.git
# or if you don't have uv installed:
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/shaneholloman/uvi.git
```

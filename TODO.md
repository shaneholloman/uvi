# TODO

- [ ] Ensure project description is printed to the github site repo page
- [ ] Ensure user has gh cli installed
- [ ] Ensure user has uv cli installed
- [ ] `info/` dir code needs proper pylint fixes!
- [ ] Pylint is included in this project but the option to add it is not available in the prompt arguments
- [ ] Add python_version option
- [ ] Add codemapper option. This would add codemapper to the project deps in case the user wants to use it.
- [ ] Consider adding how to handle .env files in the project. Could be handy to have a prompt argument that ask for repo secrets and add them via gh cli.
- [ ] Improve the docs-deploy function in our root MakeFile.

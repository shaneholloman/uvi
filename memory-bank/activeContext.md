# UVI Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus has been implementing the ability to prefill the cookiecutter prompts with the user's git username and email. This feature has now been successfully implemented and verified using proper implementation workflow.

## Recent Changes

- The project is currently at version 0.3.3
- A memory bank structure has been established to document the project systematically
- Core documentation files have been created to capture project knowledge
- The .clinerules file was updated with comprehensive feature implementation workflow
- Implementation of git user prefill for cookiecutter prompts has been properly verified

## Implementation Details: User Info Prefill

### Previous Behavior (Documented)

- Users had to manually enter their name, email, and GitHub handle every time they created a new project
- The template didn't check for or use local git configuration
- Default values were hardcoded personal information in cookiecutter.json

### New Behavior (Verified)

#### Tiered Information Sources

1. **GitHub CLI (Primary Source)**

   - If available and authenticated, retrieves user profile from GitHub API
   - Provides the most accurate GitHub handle along with name and email
   - Displays a message when using GitHub account info

2. **Git Configuration (Fallback)**

   - If GitHub CLI isn't available, falls back to git config
   - Prioritizes local repository config over global config
   - Tries to extract GitHub handle from GitHub-style emails
   - Displays messages about which values are being used

3. **Generic Defaults (Last Resort)**
   - If neither GitHub nor git is available, uses generic placeholders
   - Ensures users never see someone else's personal information

#### Key Improvements

- Cross-platform command detection (works on Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Proper error handling for all external commands
- Detailed user feedback about information sources
- Maintains the interactive prompt experience
- Clear separation of concerns in the code structure

### Additional Improvements

- Removed hardcoded personal information from config files
- Changed default values to generic placeholders ("Your Name", "<your.email@example.com>")
- Added proper handling for missing/unavailable tools
- Made the implementation OS-agnostic

### Implementation Details

1. Added `get_git_config_value` function to safely retrieve git configuration values

   - Added check to verify git is installed using `shutil.which`
   - Properly handles errors if git command fails or values aren't set
   - Uses `subprocess.check_output` with appropriate error handling

2. Added `get_git_user_info` function to collect user information

   - Gets name from git config user.name
   - Gets email from git config user.email
   - Attempts to extract GitHub handle from email if it follows GitHub patterns

3. Modified main function to:
   - Get git user info before invoking cookiecutter
   - Pass this info as `extra_context` to cookiecutter

### Testing and Verification

1. Documented baseline behavior using actual tool execution
2. Set up test environment with custom git config values
3. Ran the tool with implementation and verified correct behavior
4. Documented improvements and compared before/after experiences

### Technical Considerations Addressed

- Handles cases where git isn't installed by using `shutil.which` to check for git
- Handles cases where git config values aren't set by only including values that exist
- Maintains backward compatibility with previous versions (the tool works exactly the same if git isn't available)
- Does not modify the cookiecutter.json template structure, only prefills values
- Uses proper error handling and follows the project's coding standards
- Passes all linting, type checking, and actual execution tests

## Next Steps

1. Implement the git user prefill feature in the CLI
2. Test the implementation with various scenarios
3. Update documentation to reflect the new capability
4. Consider implementing other items from the TODO list in future work

## Active Decisions

- Keep the implementation simple and focused on local git config
- Don't attempt to fetch GitHub-specific information (like the GitHub handle) at this stage
- Maintain backward compatibility with current usage patterns
- Implement error handling for cases where git isn't available or config values aren't set

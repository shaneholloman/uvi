# UVI Future Strategy

> Cookiecutter Maintenance Concerns and Future Strategy

## Current Status Assessment

As of March 2025, we've identified a potential concern regarding Cookiecutter's development activity:

- The last significant commit to the [Cookiecutter repository](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) was approximately 8-9 months ago
- While the project has 23.2K stars indicating wide adoption, the lack of recent maintenance is noteworthy
- Cookiecutter has reached a level of maturity where fewer updates might be expected, but the complete absence of activity raises questions
- No clear communication about the project's status has been provided by maintainers

## Implications for UVI

UVI currently relies heavily on Cookiecutter as its core templating engine. This dependency presents several considerations:

1. **Stability vs. Innovation**: A mature, stable codebase has advantages, but could also indicate stagnation
2. **Security Concerns**: Unmaintained dependencies may eventually develop security vulnerabilities
3. **Compatibility Issues**: As Python, UV, and other tools evolve, an unmaintained Cookiecutter might encounter compatibility problems
4. **Feature Development**: UVI's feature roadmap could be constrained by limitations in an unmaintained dependency

## Strategic Options

We are considering several approaches to address this concern:

### 1. Incremental Decoupling

Gradually reduce tight coupling with Cookiecutter while maintaining compatibility:

- Move more logic into UVI's own codebase
- Use Cookiecutter as a library rather than a direct command wrapper
- Create abstractions that could work with different template engines

### 2. Fork Insurance

Consider creating a maintenance fork that we control:

- Maintain a UVI-specific fork of Cookiecutter as a fallback
- Sync periodically with upstream but be ready to diverge if needed
- This provides insurance if the original project becomes abandoned

### 3. Expand Wrapper Capabilities

Build more value in the wrapper layer that isn't dependent on Cookiecutter:

- Additional UVI-specific features as discussed in CLI enhancements
- Post-processing capabilities after Cookiecutter runs
- More intelligent defaults and project-specific optimizations

### 4. Template Engine Abstraction

Consider a long-term plan to support multiple template engines:

- Design an abstraction layer that could work with Cookiecutter, Copier, or others
- Start with Cookiecutter but be architecturally ready to plug in alternatives
- This future-proofs UVI against changes in the template engine landscape

## Request for Community Input

We're actively seeking input from the UVI community on this matter. If you have thoughts, concerns, or suggestions regarding UVI's relationship with Cookiecutter, please share them by:

1. Opening an issue on our GitHub repository with the tag `cookiecutter-strategy`
2. Joining the discussion in our community channels
3. Sending your thoughts directly to the maintainers

Specifically, we'd like to hear:

- Your assessment of Cookiecutter's current maintenance status
- Experience with similar situations in other projects
- Opinions on the strategic options outlined above
- Alternative approaches we haven't considered
- Willingness to contribute to any of the proposed strategies

## Implementation Considerations

Any strategy should balance:

1. Not reinventing the wheel (Cookiecutter works well for core functionality)
2. Protecting UVI from upstream risks
3. Continuing to deliver unique value through UVI's opinionated approach
4. Maintaining backward compatibility during transitions

## Next Steps

Based on community feedback, we will:

1. Document the prevailing community perspective
2. Select a strategic approach with appropriate timeframes
3. Create implementation tickets for the selected strategy
4. Add relevant tasks to our roadmap

Your input is valuable in helping shape the future direction of UVI and ensuring it remains a robust, reliable tool for Python project templating.
